6.        
            Form {
                Picker("Select student", selection: $selectedStudent ) {
                    ForEach(students, id: \.self) {
                        Text($0)
                    }
                    
                }
            }
//Ask stackoverflow?
What is the Text($0) index referring to for arguments here?


7. Understanding .decorations vs not, how to make intuitive? (For example, .percentage and .number)

8.                        ForEach(1..<10) {
                            Text($0, format: .percent)
                        }  Why that is valid but below is not

                        ForEach(1…10) {
                            Text($0, format: .percent)
                        }

9. Why is this out of scope?

                Section {
                var total = addTip(percentage: tipAmount, to: Double(checkAmount))
                    
                    Text("Grand total \(total)")
                }
                Section {
                var perPerson = (addTip(percentage: tipAmount, to: Double(checkAmount))) / Double(numberOfPeople)
                    
                    Text("Per Person \(perPerson)")
                }
